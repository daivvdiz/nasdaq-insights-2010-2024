# NASDAQ Insights (2010–2025)

This project contains a **descriptive analysis** of the NASDAQ index’s behavior, compared with the performance of **gold**, **oil**, and the **EFFR interest rate** between 2010 and 2025.

While the full data range is considered for context, the core analytical focus narrows to **2015–2025**, to reduce noise from early post-crisis volatility and highlight more stable macroeconomic dynamics.

## 📌 Objective

To examine how monetary policy decisions and macroeconomic shocks—especially **COVID-19**, **EFFR rate changes**, and **sector-specific momentum**—have influenced NASDAQ’s growth and cyclical behavior in the last decade.

## 📈 Contents

- CT% (Total Growth) and CAGR% (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for NASDAQ, gold, and oil.
- Time series visualizations by **quarter** and **year**.
- Interpretation of market dynamics in periods of low interest rates and economic stimulus.
- Exploration of **gold as a safe-haven asset** during monetary shifts.
- Detection of **repeating seasonal investment patterns** in the NASDAQ‑100.

## 🔍 Key Finding

A recurring pattern was identified:  
> After a NASDAQ‑100 dip in **Q4**, there tends to be a strong **Q1 rebound**, followed by 2–3 years of moderate, consistent growth.

According to current 2025 data, this cycle may be repeating. Based on the observed trend, **Q3 2025 could present a strategic investment entry point**, provided monetary conditions remain stable.
