In a quick descriptive analysis, the following can be observed:

From the chart, we can calculate the total and compound annual percentage growth of each asset to compare them:

$$CT\%=(Vend−VstartVstart)⋅100CT\% = \left(\frac{V_{end} - V_{start}}{V_{start}}\right) \cdot 100$$[^2] _Total Growth Formula (CT) – Percentage_


$$CAGR\%=((VendVstart)1/n−1)⋅100CAGR\% = \left(\left(\frac{V_{end}}{V_{start}}\right)^{1/n} - 1\right) \cdot 100$$
[^3] _Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) – Percentage_


| $Asset$  | $CT\%$       | $CAGR\%$    |
| -------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| _NASDAQ_ | $\$954.5285$ | $\$6.4958$  |
| _Oil_    | $-\$8.7064$  | $-\$0.649$  |
| _Gold_   | $\$141.3530$ | $\$18.3248$ |

When observing the data by annual periods, something **extraordinary occurs between 2020 and 2021**: while the [[NASDAQ]] index grows by nearly **50%**, the price of gold rises only **1.15%**.

According to my analysis, this behavior is directly related to the impact of **COVID-19**. Although the global economy **did not fall into an official recession**, there was a **sharp slowdown** due to lockdowns, industrial shutdowns, and trade restrictions. In response, the U.S. Federal Reserve (**the Fed**) implemented several measures to **stimulate economic flow**, including:

- Aggressively reducing the [[Fed & EFFR|EFFR]] to nearly **0%**.
    
- This made **loans cheaper and more abundant**, which encouraged spending —and most importantly, investment in sectors like technology.
    

This scenario gave a significant boost to the [[NASDAQ]], which is mostly made up of tech companies, while gold —a non-speculative, safe-haven asset— **lost relevance compared to the surge in stock market enthusiasm**.

Below is the behavior of the [[NASDAQ & EFFR vs Time|EFFR]] over time from 2010 to 2024:

### **Conclusion:**

The analysis holds true. At the end of Q1 2020, the Federal Reserve decided to reduce the [[Fed & EFFR|EFFR]] to nearly **0%**, aiming to stimulate the economy during the COVID-19 crisis. This reduction encouraged individuals and businesses to take out cheap loans, which led to a significant increase in investment —especially in **stock markets** like the [[NASDAQ]].

### **Analysis of Gold Behavior Between 2012 and 2015**

Anomalous behavior can be observed in the average value of gold from 2012 to 2015. Although the [[Fed & EFFR|EFFR]] remained close to 0%, the [[NASDAQ]] stayed relatively stable in 2012, with an average value of $8.19 USD. However, gold began a sharp decline, losing approximately **30.54%** of its value during that period.

_**Conclusion:**_  
According to my analysis, the economy remained so stagnant that many investors —both retail and institutional— chose to liquidate gold positions to free up cash, take out cheap loans, and redirect that capital into the stock market, especially toward high-growth potential sectors like the [[NASDAQ]]. This aligns with the fact that the [[NASDAQ]] grew **108.83%** between 2012 and 2015.

It wasn’t until 2015 that gold prices began to stabilize and then rise again, coinciding with a shift in monetary policy: the [[Fed & EFFR|Fed]] began a gradual interest rate hike cycle, reaching **0.14%** by 2016. This increase reduced market liquidity and led investors to once again view gold as a safe haven, which explains its recovery in the following years.

## **Analysis of NASDAQ‑100 and EFFR (2015–2025)**

This analysis shortens the timeline to **reduce noise** caused by earlier events like the 2010 financial crisis. From 2015 onward, the economy regained momentum and entered a more stable growth phase.

Currently, we observe a **stabilization** in the relationship between the **Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR)** and the **NASDAQ‑100**. However, there's a notable pattern:

> When the NASDAQ‑100 **declines during Q4**, and the **drop starts around Q1 or Q2**, the following **Q1 tends to show a significant upward trend** — often followed by 2–3 years of moderate but consistent growth.

In 2025, early signs of this trend are beginning to appear. This suggests that **Q3 of 2025 could be an ideal entry point** to invest, especially if market behavior remains stable. The optimal move would be to invest **before Q4 begins**, hold through the dip, and ride the recovery in Q1 and beyond.

![[NASDAQ100_vs_EFFR.png]]

### **Why does this pattern happen?**

This trend is likely driven by **seasonal and cyclical forces** in the tech and financial sectors:

- **Spring (Q1)** often marks the beginning of the innovation cycle:
    - Tech companies like **Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, and SpaceX** launch new products, research, or forecasts.
    - Investor sentiment becomes optimistic around **future-driven sectors**: biotechnology, aerospace, automotive innovation, AI, etc.
    - The **U.S. government**, through investment bonds and subsidies, channels capital into tech and research-intensive companies.
    
- At the same time, **portfolio rotation** takes place:
    - Investors **take profits or rebalance** during Q4 (tax strategies, de-risking).
    - They reallocate capital in Q1 into promising sectors.
    - This creates **euphoria and growth cycles** in high-tech indexes like the NASDAQ‑100.

### **Current EFFR Impact and Global Risk**

At the moment, the **EFFR remains stable**, meaning monetary policy is not likely to distort this trend in the short term.

However, geopolitical tensions — such as the **USA–Iran conflict** — could disrupt domestic economic stability. If internal shocks emerge:

- The Fed **may be forced to raise interest rates**, which would **negatively impact the stock market**.
- In that case, converting tech holdings into **liquid assets** or **gold** may be a safe hedge to protect purchasing power during volatility.

Still, such scenarios are unlikely to unfold **immediately**, as any Fed decision requires **careful planning** and long-term economic signals.
